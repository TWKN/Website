## ROADMAP

This is the roadmap for the layout.
The structure of the website will be *regularly* updated here. You can also create issues, but that's better for **fixing code**, not for creating.

+ **#WhatIs**: the first section will be mostly general, a 200-word maximum description of TWKN as an *all-in-one platform*, with **Startups**, **Network** and **Blog**. [DONE = COVER SECTION]
+ **#Startups**: Short description of the platform as a database, with button that redirects to [startups.twkn.org](http://startups.twkn.org)
+ **#Network**: Short description of the platform as a hub for startups and freelancers, with button that redirects to [network.twkn.org](http://network.twkn.org)
+ **#Blog**: Short description of the blog as an european newspaper providing exclusive content about startups and tech news and reviews, with button that redirects to [blog.twkn.org](http://blog.twkn.org), that automatically redirects to [tweaknology.org](http://tweaknology.org)


This is meant to be a long-scroll landing page.
