# TWKN

##### This is the official repo for the development of all the platforms made by TWKN.

TWKN will be a company. It's not that, *yet*. It's created as a spin-off of **[Tweaknology.org](http://tweaknology.org=)**, a blog
about *tech and and innovation*.

As we write, the state of the development is the following:
+ Quick development of a "work in progress" website;
+ Development of a one-responsive-page website;

Our plans for the future are (to be completed, hopefully, by *the end of 2016*):
+ Development of a **platform** that can hold database instances about projects and startups in Italy (CrunchBase-simile);
+ Development of a **platform** that can hold database instances about people, filtering them through queries run from the **frontend**, *on-the-go*, to develop a platform for communication team-building, for startups that don't have one (here, in Italy, *there are a lot*.)

If you wanna help, please contact <blog@twkn.org> or <developer@twkn.org> for further informations about our projects (*it's not like we don't want to open source it*, we just don't update the README **regularly**.)
